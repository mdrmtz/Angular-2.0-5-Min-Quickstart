# Angular-2.0-Five-Min-Quickstart
Angular is still unpackaged and in alpha. This quickstart does not reflect the final build process for Angular.

Run a local HTTP server, and view index.html.

If you don't already have an HTTP server, you can install one using npm install -g http-server. (If that results in an access error, then you might need to use sudo npm ...) For example:


### From the directory that contains index.html:


```
	npm install -g http-server  # Or sudo npm install -g http-server
	http-server                 # Creates a server at localhost:8080
```
### In a browser, visit [localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)
